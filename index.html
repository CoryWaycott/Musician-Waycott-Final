    <h1>Who is Quadeca?</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Benjamin "Ben" Lasky (born October 2, 2000), better known as Quadeca, is an American hip hop artist, producer, and former video game commentator. He uploads rap songs, music videos, comedy sketches, and video gameplay to his Youtube channel which as of April 2021, has more than 212 million video views and over 1.9 million subscribers. Quadeca has released five full-length studio albums: Work in Progress (2015), Nostalgia for the Now (2016), Bad Internet Rapper (2017), Out of Order (2017), Voice Memos (2019), and From Me to You (2021). He launched his YouTube channel in June of 2012 as QuadecaX8 originally and became known for uploading FIFA-related content at that time. He is from Los Angeles, California. </p>

    <p>The reason why this music artist is considered my favorite is because his perspective on music is right up my alley. His music is deemed very lyrically composed rather than rapping about money, fame, or fast cars. Some of his influences come from his friends such as Crpyt, Dax, and other popular figures such as NF, and Juice WRLD. Some of his songs are relatable personally but to an audience in general.   </p>
